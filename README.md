# GoKnock - v0.3 

#### Please make sure to actually utilize the README. 

Designed to validate potential usernames by querying OneDrive and/or Microsoft Teams, which are passive methods.  
It can output/create a list of legacy Skype users identified through Microsoft Teams enumeration.
It can also get details from Teams, such as availability, device type, and out of office message.
Finally, it also creates a nice clean list for future usage, all conducted from a single tool. 

If youre having problems with the token, you didnt go through the README, or you didnt use the interactive firefox option.

Compiled releases found in the [RELEASES](https://github.com/waffl3ss/GoKnock/releases) page.

If building from source:
```
go mod init GoKnock
go mod tidy
go build
```

### v0.3 Initial Release
- Initial release of the go version of KnockKnock.

### Latest 
- Microsoft changed things (as always) and had to figure out a new method of getting the TenantID to use in the OneDrive Enum stuffs.
- If you cant get the token normally, you can use `-t proxy` to have a selenium firefox browser open on your system, where you login to your MS account, and it grabs the token for you before exiting and continuing the enumeration. 
- Teams has changed the what the teams token can access. It can still enumerate teams for now, but cant do the teams status. Therefore, at the end of the README, ive included a way to manually get a better token that can do both. That being said, the interactive proxy mode (`-t proxy`) gets the better token right away.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Options
- You can select one or both modes, as long as the appropriate options are provided for the modules selected.
- When running both OneDrive and Teams enumeration, it will remove verified users from the first function as to not check them again in the second function. 
- Both modules will require the domain flag (-d) and the user input list (-i).  
- The tool does not require an output file as an option, and if not supplied, it will print to screen only.  
- Verbose mode outputs a lot of data, but even more so when using the proxy. You have been warned.
- The Teams option requires a bearer token. The script automatically parses the token to get whats needed for authentication. (highly recommend the `-t proxy` option to get the token)  
- The LEGACY (-l) option shows users that still have SkypeID settings and will write it to a seperate file (Output option (-o) required).
- The STATUS (-s) option shows user teams availability, device, and OutOfOffice message, then writes it to a seperate file (Output option (-o) required). (Old teams token dosnt work for this. Documentation on getting the new token is at the bottom of the README)

# Getting Your Token
The teams token has changed. You can still get the token by using a web browser, logging into teams, opening the dev tools, and getting the authtoken cookie. With that said, the authtoken cookie no longer has access to additional information outside of the general enumeration. So youll know why youre not getting status if you use that token.

There is another token that can be used, but requires more interaction. I have modified the interactive firefox (`-t proxy`) to get the correct token, so use that if you cant figure out the rest. 

For an example of how to get the other special token, you need to proxy through burp. Setup burp and a fresh browser, go to `https://teams.microsoft.com` and login. Once the loading is complete, youre going to look for a POST request to `https://login.microsoftonline.com` and the endpoint will be something like this `/123a4b56-789c-12def3h4i567/oauth2/v2.0/token?client-request-id=Core-z9y8765x-432w-10v9-ut87-6s543r2109q8` and within the response json youll see a value for "access_token". Thats the value you want to use for the token. 

Note: There will be a few POST to endpoints with `/oauth2/v2.0/token?` in it. Make sure to find the one that I mention above, obviously the random values are fake in this and will be completly different in your request. Again, the interactive proxy takes care of all this for you...
